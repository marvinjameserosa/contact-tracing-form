# Contact Tracing Form


## Project Description

The contact tracing form was developed as a school assignment with the goal of facilitating easy building access management during the pandemic. Created using Windows Form, this project marks my inaugural venture into utilizing libraries and integrating a camera and QR system.

Please be aware that this project requires Visual Studio with .NET desktop development installed for execution, as no standalone executable file is provided. Simply open the project within Visual Studio to begin playing.

## Features:

- Straightforward question prompts ensure efficient tracking.

- Generate unique QR codes for each user and utilize a built-in reader for seamless processing.
